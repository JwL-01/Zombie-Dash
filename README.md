Your mission is crystal clear: navigate through an intricate maze infested with ravenous zombies, all while collecting essential food items to ensure your survival. The clock is ticking, and the undead horde is relentless in its pursuit. The town, your beacon of hope, awaits you at the end of the treacherous path. Can you reach it before it's too late?

**Project Goals & Objectives**

In this project we learned how to create a maze game using only Java, no frameworks or engines were involved in the creation of Zombie Dash. We used libraries from JavaFx, JavaAWT, and JavaSwing to facilitate the application. A simple algorithms were implemented to follow and chase the player. Every playthrough is a unique experience, as the food items appear in different locations each time you play. Customs sprites were created by us to draw the characters on screen.

The controls are simple. Utilize the WASD keys for movement.
