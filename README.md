Your mission is crystal clear: navigate through an intricate maze infested with ravenous zombies, all while collecting essential food items to ensure your survival. The clock is ticking, and the undead horde is relentless in its pursuit. The town, your beacon of hope, awaits you at the end of the treacherous path. Can you reach it before it's too late?

Armed with nothing but your wits and the keys at your fingertips, you must master the art of evasion and strategy. The controls are simple yet crucial: use the WASD keys to move swiftly through the maze, making split-second decisions to outwit the pursuing zombies. Along the way, keep your eyes peeled for stars that offer bonus points, adding an extra layer of challenge for those who dare to strive for excellence.

But tread carefully, as danger lurks around every corner. The maze is littered with cunningly placed traps that can halt your progress in an instant. One misstep could lead you straight into the jaws of the relentless undead or trigger a perilous trap that spells doom. The stakes are high, and the margin for error is razor-thin.

Every playthrough is a unique experience, as the food items appear in different locations each time you embark on your daring dash. This dynamic element keeps you on your toes, demanding adaptability and a keen sense of exploration as you strive to gather all the sustenance you need for survival.

Zombie Dash is not just a game; it's a test of your survival instincts, quick reflexes, and strategic thinking. Do you have what it takes to outmaneuver the zombie horde, navigate the maze's twists and turns, and emerge victorious? The town's safety lies in your hands. It's time to run, gather, and conquer â€“ or become just another victim of the infectious outbreak. The choice is yours.
